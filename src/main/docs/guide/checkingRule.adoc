Once we have created the rule and it's available on the classpath it's time to add it to the Grails application.

[source, groovy]
./app/src/codenarc/rules.groovy
----
ruleset {
    description 'Grails-CodeNarc Project RuleSet'

    ...
    ruleset('rulesets/grails-extra.xml')
}

----


Now we can create a service and use Spring `@Transactional` on it:

[source, groovy]
./app/build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/services/demo/DemoService.groovy[]
----

And the final step is generating the CodeNarc report:

As we can see we have a new violation because the rule we created as been applied.
