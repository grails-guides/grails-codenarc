Adding CodeNarc to our project is a simple task because there's a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/codenarc_plugin.html[Gradle plugin]
 to do it.

Let's modify `build.gradle` and add the following:

[source, groovy]
./app/build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/build.gradle[tag=applyCodenarc]

include::{sourcedir}/app/build.gradle[tag=codenarcTask]
----

<1> Apply the `codenarc` plugin.
<2> Set the CodeNarc version we want to use.
<3> Define the main file with the rules. By default CodeNarc uses `config/codenarc/codenarc.xml` but we don't want to
write XML files, don't we?
<4> The report format we want. For a human-ready format we use `html`. If we want to integrate CodeNarc with, for
example, Jenkins we need to change it to `xml`.
<5> Because we don't want that the build fails when there's only one violation.

Then we need to create the rules file:

[source, groovy]
./app/src/codenarc/rules.groovy
----
ruleset {
    description 'Grails-CodeNarc Project RuleSet'

    ruleset('rulesets/basic.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/braces.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/convention.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/design.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/dry.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/exceptions.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/formatting.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/generic.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/imports.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/naming.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/unnecessary.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/unused.xml')
    ruleset('rulesets/grails.xml')
}
----

With this configuration we can just run the `check` task.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew :app:check

:check UP-TO-DATE
:complete:codenarcMain
CodeNarc rule violations were found. See the report at: file:///home/ivan/workspaces/oci/guides/grails-codenarc/complete/app/build/reports/codenarc/main.html
:complete:codenarcTest NO-SOURCE
:complete:compileJava NO-SOURCE
:complete:compileGroovy UP-TO-DATE
:complete:buildProperties UP-TO-DATE
:complete:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:complete:classes UP-TO-DATE
:complete:compileTestJava NO-SOURCE
:complete:compileTestGroovy NO-SOURCE
:complete:processTestResources NO-SOURCE
:complete:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
:complete:test NO-SOURCE
:complete:check

Total time: 1.953 secs
----

And we can open the test report to check the violations:

First we have section with the execution date and the CodeNarc version used. Then there's another section with a Summary
with the total of files with violations and also the number of violations with priority 1, 2 and 3. After that there's
a section for each file in which we can see all the violations in the file with the line of code and a small fragment
of it. The rule name is a link to a more detailed explanation.


=== Let's fix the violations

There are different ways of fixing a CodeNarc violation:

- Fixing the problem: As the name implies, just fix the violation.
- Disabling the rule: Some times we don't agree with that specific CodeNarc violation, so we can disable it.
- Ignoring the rule for that specific class or method: This case is when we don't want to disable the rule but want to
skip it only in a particular class or method.


==== Fixing the problem

We're going to fix the violations `FileEndsWithoutNewline` and `SpaceBeforeOpeningBrace` adding a new line at the end
of the `UrlMappings.groovy` file and a space before the braces.

==== Disabled the rule

For the case of `ClassJavadoc` and `NoDef` we can just disable the rules modifying the `rules.groovy` file:

[source, groovy]
./app/src/codenarc/rules.groovy
----
ruleset {
    description 'Grails-CodeNarc Project RuleSet'

    ...
    ruleset('rulesets/convention.xml') {
        'NoDef' {
            enabled = false
        }
    }
    ...
    ruleset('rulesets/formatting.xml') {
        'ClassJavadoc' {
            enabled = false
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

==== Ignoring a rule

Finally we can ignore a rule for a specific class. In this case we're going to ignore the `UnnecessaryGString` rule
for `UrlMappings.groovy` using `@SuppressWarnings`:

[source, groovy]
./app/grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/app/grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy[tag=urlMappings]
----


==== Checking the result

Just execute again the `check` task and open the report to see that all the violations are gone:
