When we write code, it's important to follow some rules, right practices, style rules, etc. However, sometimes it is not that
simple. It is even more important when we work in a team, in which every member has his preferences. One way of
improving this is adding a static analysis tool for the code.

In this guide, you are going to install and configure http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/[Codenarc] to help you improve the
 quality of your Grails code, and you are also going to learn how to create a custom CodeNarc rule.
 CodeNarc analyzes the Groovy code and reports potential bugs and code problems.
