=== Create the project

We need to create a new Groovy project because we want to package the rule in its own jar file using Gradle.

[source, groovy]
./codenarc-rule/build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/codenarc-rule/build.gradle[]
----
<1> Only need CodeNarc dependency

In order to be able to user this new CodeNarc rule in our Grails application we need to make sure that the jar file
is available in the classpath during the `codenarcMain` taks:

[source, groovy]
./gradle/codenarc.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/gradle/codenarc.gradle[tag=codeNarcClasspath]
----
<1> `codenarcMain` depends on the jar being generated
<2> Add the jar to the `codenarcClasspath`

TIP: If you want to use CodeNarc to also check your tests code you need to do the same for the `codenarcTest` task.


==== Define the rule

The first step is create a meta-information file with the information about the rule we want to create:

[source, xml]
./codenarc-rule/src/main/resources/rulesets/grails-extra.xml
----
include::{sourcedir}/codenarc-rule/src/main/resources/rulesets/grails-extra.xml[]
----
<1> The description of the group of rules.
<2> One `rule` element per rule we create.


Second we create a properties file with the description of the rule in both plain text and html. The messages will be
used in the html report:

[source, xml]
./codenarc-rule/src/main/resources/codenarc-messages.properties
----
include::{sourcedir}/codenarc-rule/src/main/resources/codenarc-messages.properties[]
----

=== Implement the rule

Finally we implement the rule:

[source, groovy]
./codenarc-rule/src/main/groovy/org/codenarc/rule/grails/GrailsTransactionalRule.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/codenarc-rule/src/main/groovy/org/codenarc/rule/grails/GrailsTransactionalRule.groovy[]
----
<1> The rule needs to extends from `AbstractAstVisitorRule`
<2> Define the violation priority
<3> The name of the rule. It needs to be the same as defined previously in the meta-information file
<4> The class that implements the rule
<5> The visitor class needs to extends from `AbstractAstVisitor`
<6> Check the annotations of the class and methods and in case that Spring `@Transactional` is used, add a new violation
<7> Check the imports of the class and is case of Spring `@Transactional` is imported, add a new violation
<8> It's important to set the `lineNumber` of the node because if not, the violation won't be added

=== Testing

And of course we need to write tests to make sure that everything is working as expected:

[source, groovy]
./codenarc-rule/src/test/groovy/org/codenarc/rule/grails/GrailsTransactionalRuleTest.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/codenarc-rule/src/test/groovy/org/codenarc/rule/grails/GrailsTransactionalRuleTest.groovy[]
----
<1> The test class needs to extends from `AbstractRuleTestCase`
<2> Instantiate the rule we want to test
<3> Write the source code we want to test as a String
<4> In this case, as we use Grails `@Transactional` we expect no violations
<5> As we use Spring `@Transactional` we expect to have one violation
