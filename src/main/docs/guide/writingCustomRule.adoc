Although CodeNarc provides some http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/codenarc-rules-grails.html[rules] specific for Grails,
some times we may want to create our own rules.

In this example we're going to create a rule to check that we use  + 
`grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` instead of
`@org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional`. + 
As you probably know the Grails `@Transactional` annotation is better because it doesn't create a runtime proxy. It's an AST Transformation that it's applied during compilation time, so there's no runtime overhead. There's also other features that the Grails annotation provides and
the Spring one don't.

NOTE: `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` is only available for the latest versions of GORM (this guide uses GORM {gormVersion}), for previous versions you should use `@grails.transaction.Transactional`.

The rule checks our code. If we use the Spring annotation, it adds a new violation to the report.
