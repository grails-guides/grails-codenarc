Although CodeNarc provides some http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/codenarc-rules-grails.html[rules] specific for Grails,
some times we may want to create our own rules.

In this example we're going to create a rule to check that we use `@grails.transaction.Transactional` instead of
`@org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional`. As you probably know the Grails `@Transactional` annotation
is better because it doesn't create a runtime proxy because it's just an AST Transformation that it's applied during
compilation time, so there's no runtime overhead. There's also other features that the Grails annotation provides and
the Spring one don't.

The rule will check our code and if we use the Spring annotation it will add a new violation to the report.
